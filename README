PyXmppBot

Wei Liu <liuw@liuw.name>

PyXmppBot is a XMPP bot framework written in Python. It's inspired by
PyGtalkRobot. But it's more extensible than PyGtalkRobot. 

A significant advantage over PyGtalkRobot is that it supports dynamic
message handler registering. That handler can either be a class method 
or a function.

I'm planning to support xmlrpc. So it's possible to setup a robot
server in the near future.

PyXmppBot is distributed under GPLv2, enjoy it.
